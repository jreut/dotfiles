# checklist

What to do when I walk up to a new Apple computer

- Make sure I have Git
- Install Homebrew if I'm on OSX
- Generate a keypair
- Add the public key to my GitHub account
- Clone my dotfiles repository
- Inside that repository, `brew tap homebrew/bundle && brew bundle`
- Write or copy an `~/.rcrc` file
- `rcup`
- configure Apple Terminal (I could probably do something like [this](https://mths.be/macos) to automate)
